	<pre id="1">I come with no wrapping or pretty pink bows.
I am who I am, from my head to my toes.
I tend to get loud when speaking my mind.
Even a little crazy some of the time.
I'm not a size 5 and don't care to be.
You can be you and I can be me.
I try to stay strong when pain knocks me down.
And the times that I cry are when no one's around.
To error is human or so that's what they say.
Well, tell me who's perfect anyway.

	<pre id="2">There's beauty in struggle,
There's feeling in pain.
For every painstaking mistake,
There are lessons you can name.

No one is excluded
From life's many trials,
Not even a scrape on the knee
From an innocent child.

It's true, most lessons do hurt.
Some more than others,
Some short and temporary,
Some smothering with suffering.

Some beautiful with love,
Like a baby and mother.
Some are a constant battle,
Like sister and brother.

There are lessons we must learn
About how to love one another.
	</pre>
	</td>
<td>
	
	<pre id="3">For every time I've failed,
For every time I've screwed up,
For every time I've said "I'm Sorry,"
And for every time I've not.

For every heart I've broken,
For every stone unturned,
For every one I've damaged
Due to an action or spoken word.

No, I'm not a loser.
I know I am no failure.
Some things take longer to learn.
In the end, I'll have things mastered.

Regret? I've had aplenty.
Self-loathing? I've lived that, too.
Walked away too many times,
Stepping closer to something new.

I know where I'm going.
I'm taking longer than I should,
But these setbacks are not failures,
Only detours through Wisdom's Woods.

	<pre id="4">If you must go, then go for a while
Remember that first step is a hard traveled mile.

To learn what lessons life has in store,
You must be willing to open each door.

Don't be afraid to experience something new
For each experience will be a benefit to you.

Never live your life in the past
Enjoy every day as if it were your last

Mistakes you will make along the way
Learn from them, and you'll be okay

Set your goals high and strive for them
As long as you try, you'll never be condemned

Be kind and respect the people you meet
For they may be the ones to make life complete

Be sincere in everything you do
And treat others as you wish they would you

Whatever you do, make sure you're content
For the last thing you want is something to resent

So if you must go, then go for a while
And when you return, return with a smile.

	<pre id="5">When things seem difficult miserable
Life is turning away from you
Intimidated and worn out you remain
In darkness at a corner you examine
Watching the sky as it disappears
Reminding the lost beloved ones
How beautiful and caring they were
Vanishing without saying goodbye
Shortening your long life span
And leaving you destitute and lonely
Deeply you wonder
How life can really be unfair
To honest and good people like you
But all you let go off
And focus to mend your life
And strengthen your heart
With good and caring friends on your side
Opening the picture of brightness
Knowing GOD holds your hand
Leading you to your success
Stars embracing the whole sky
And you know your journey has started
In pursuit of your purpose
Slowly matching from dusk to dawn
With smiles and determination
In whispers you read your heart
ALWAYS STAND STRONG

	<pre id="6">First day Lily arrived late from school
Mom thought she was playing the fool
Angrily, what happened asked she
Lily replied "A monster detained me"
Mom said "That is so absurd!"
There are no monsters in this world

The second day her schoolwork was in a mess
Mom thought that she was being careless
She asked "What were you doing all day?
From the monster, I was trying to hide away
Mom said "This is so absurd!"
There are no monsters in this world

The third day Lily refused to go at all
Mom felt it was just a tantrum small
She threatened her with a beating
Lily replied "The monster may be waiting"
Mom said "This is so absurd!"
There are no monsters in this world

The fourth day, Lily complained of a stomach ache
Mom said please do not fake
She said I am tired of your repeated lies
Lily replied "The monster will make me cry"
Mom said "This is so absurd!"
There are no monsters in this world

The fifth day, Lily fell ill and took to her bed
Mom forced her to go to school instead
She ranted at her, asked her why
The monster will hurt me, I shall surely die
Mom said "This is so absurd!"
There are no monsters in this world

For this little girl, there was no sixth sunrise
For her new teacher was a monster in disguise
He caught her alone and took her life
After torturing her for hours with a knife
Monsters are real, the mom realized too late
If only she could have saved her baby from this fate

So listen to your child's stories really well
About her little anxieties they may tell
A sordid tale may be hidden in her tears,
Lend a patient ear to her innocent fears.
Pay attention to her words and understand
For her safety and security lie in your hands.
